% Use listings and tcolorbox to make text chunk boxes that can be wrapped. Seehttps://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/234276/boxed-text-inside-tcolorbox-tcblisting. If only using verbatim, code chunk lines run off the document as wrapping can't be computed

% Say which tcolorbox libraries to use

 % Try to define a style for listing in text chunks that allows comment lines to be printed in a different colour - in progress
